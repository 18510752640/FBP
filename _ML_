Machine learning is very important, and this is what I sum up from this project: the model needs to be iteratively modified, 
that is, back propagation. We should improve the model through data from different dimensions and stages.
Depending on the dimension of the feature vectors you extract, after repeated verification of the different number of dimensions 
in this project, it is concluded that the best effect can be achieved when the dimension is 3, and the gambling company is 
an individual.
Now it's time to collect data from N gambling companies. A can provide false information, but BCDE can't provide false information 
at the same time in a game.
So the "three-board model" I'm exploring is based on three boards to determine a stable geometry, that is, 
three gambling companies can determine the outcome of a game.
